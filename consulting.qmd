## Let's Work Together

I help individuals and teams **make sense of messy data**, **build smart tools**, and **tell compelling stories with evidence**.

If you're navigating the ever-changing landscape of **AI**, **data science**, or **statistical thinking**, I can help you move from confusion to clarity and from dashboards to decisions.

Interested in collaborating or just want to chat? Let's find a time to talk via [email](mailto:chester.ismay@gmail.com) or [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chesterismay/). I’d love to hear what you're working on and explore ways that I can help.

- Timely, organized, and prepared
- Always focused on your *actual* questions, not just your data
- Remote-friendly, flexible, and fun to work with
- Able to travel if meeting up in person is preferred
