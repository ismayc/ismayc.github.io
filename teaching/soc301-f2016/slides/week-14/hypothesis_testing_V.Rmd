## Hypothesis Testing in General

The **how** of these 3 points may change, but the **what** doesn't:

> 1. Identify the test statistic
> 1. Construct the null distribution of the test statistic based on $H_0$
> 1. Compare the observed test statistic to the null distribution to compute the **p-value**



## Specifics 1: Test Statistic

We can do hypothesis testing for different scenarios

Type  | Population Parameter | Test Statistic
------------- | ------------- | -------------
One-Sample  | Mean $\mu$ | Sample Mean $\overline{x}$
One-Sample  | Proportion $p$ | Sample Proportion $\widehat{p}$
Two-Sample  | Diff of Means $\mu_1 - \mu_2$ | $\overline{x}_1 - \overline{x}_2$
Two-Sample  | Diff of Proportions $p_1 - p_2$ | $\widehat{p}_1 - \widehat{p}_2$



## Specifics 2: Null Distribution

We can construct the null distribution of the test statistic either

> * Via computation i.e. simulation/sampling
> * Ex: We used the **Permutation Test** i.e. we permuted things
> * Via mathematics i.e. analytically
> * Ex: In MATH 310 Probability via the **Central Limit Theorem**: $\overline{X}$ is Normally distributed as $n \rightarrow \infty$
> * **Note**: the null distribution isn't always bell shaped! i.e. not always Normal



## Specifics 3: p-Value

Depending on the alternative hypothesis $H_A$, we have either

1. Two-sided p-values. Ex:
    + $H_A: \mu_{1} - \mu_{2} \neq 0$
1. One-sided p-values. Ex:
    + $H_A: \mu_{1} - \mu_{2} < 0$
    + $H_A: \mu_{1} - \mu_{2} > 0$



## Learning Check from Lec25

So the LC from Lec25 involving evens vs odds, we had

* $H_0: \mu_{odd} - \mu_{even} = 0$ vs
* $H_A: \mu_{odd} - \mu_{even} \neq 0$
    
This is a **two-sided permutation test for differences in means**.



## Moral of the Story

If you forget what hypothesis testing and/or p-values are remember:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=16/2, fig.height=9/2, cache=TRUE}
guess_cup <- c(1, 0)
simulation <- do(10000) * resample(guess_cup, size=8)
simulation <- simulation %>% 
  mutate(n_correct = V1 + V2 + V3 + V4 + V5 + V6 + V7 + V8) 
ggplot(simulation, aes(x=n_correct)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x="Number of Guesses Correct", title="Lady Tasting Tea") +
  geom_vline(xintercept=8, col="red") 
```
