Carefully analyze the code below:

If you wanted to produce a histogram, would the code above plot a histogram? Why or why not?

- A. Yes. The code above specifically allows RStudio to plot the dataset. 

- B. No. The code just provided a backdrop. We need to be able to plot, thus we will follow up the code with a "+". As seen in the code below. 

    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
      geom_histogram()
    ```

- C. Yes. The code above has provided the backdrop and added the layer needed to plot. 

- D. No. The code just provided a backdrop. We need to be able to plot, thus we will begin the following line with a "+". As seen in the code below. 

    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) 
      + geom_histogram()
