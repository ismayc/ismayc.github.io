## County Characteristics Datasets

### Annual County Resident Population Estimates by Age, Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin

- Downloaded from [here](https://www.census.gov/popest/data/counties/asrh/2015/CC-EST2015-ALLDATA.html) via All States (CSV)

- Codebook is available [here](https://www.census.gov/popest/data/counties/asrh/2015/files/CC-EST2015-ALLDATA.pdf)

- This dataset is messy.  I've tidied it and focused on only Total Population and Black or African American alone.

## Problem set-up


- On Exam 2, I asked you to think about using bootstrapping to provide an estimate for the range of possible values for the mean percentage of black residents in ALL US counties.

## Comparing mean percentages in two states

- Suppose we were interested in testing the mean percentage of black residents in two different states.  Let's choose Oregon and Washington.

- Washington has 39 counties and Oregon has 36.

- Assume we only have access to 20 randomly selected counties from each state.

```{r eval=FALSE}
wash_or <- read_csv("/shared/isma5720@pacificu.edu/wash-or_black.csv")
```

```{r include=FALSE}
wash_or <- read_csv("wash-or_black.csv")
```


## Problem set-up {.build}

Do we have evidence that the mean percentage of black residents in Washington and Oregon is statistically different?

- $H_A: \mu_{wa} \ne \mu_{or}$ or $H_A: \mu_{wa} - \mu_{or} \ne 0$

What is the null hypothesis?

- $H_0: \mu_{wa} = \mu_{or}$ or $H_0: \mu_{wa} - \mu_{or} = 0$

What does this mean?

- We are assuming that the mean percentage of black residents in Washington and Oregon is THE SAME.

- We will use hypothesis testing to look to see if we have evidence to go against this assumption.

## The layout of all hypothesis tests

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("ht.png", dpi = 120)
```

## For our problem {.build}

What is the **observational unit**?

- Counties in Washington and Oregon
    
DATA:  

- We have collected our sample of 20 Washington counties and 20 Oregon counties

TEST STATISTIC:  

- We are interested in the difference in sample means.

## OBSERVED EFFECT

```{r}
(state_means <- wash_or %>% group_by(state) %>% 
  summarize(mean_perc = mean(black_perc)))
(obs_diff <- diff(state_means$mean_perc))
```

- From our original (observed) sample, we have 

$$\verb+obs_diff+ = \bar{x}_{wa} - \bar{x}_{or} = 0.9105771$$

## MODEL OF $H_0$ {.build}

We assume that the two POPULATION mean percentages are the same:

$H_0: \mu_{wa} = \mu_{or}$ or $H_0: \mu_{wa} - \mu_{or} = 0$

## SIMULATED DATA {.build}

We want to use the data we have collected to simulate a process following the model for $H_0$.

This is similar to bootstrapping except in this case we have two groups instead of just one.

**BIG STEP**:  Assuming that $H_0: \mu_{wa} = \mu_{or}$, any one of the percentages we saw in our sample data could have occurred (equally) in either Washington or in Oregon.

We can use the `shuffle` function in the `mosaic` package to shuffle the percentages between Oregon and Washington.

## One shuffle

```{r}
set.seed(2016)
(shuffled_state_means <- wash_or %>%
     mutate(state = shuffle(state)) %>% 
     group_by(state) %>%
     summarize(mean_shuf_perc = mean(black_perc)))
(obs_shuf_diff <- diff(shuffled_state_means$mean_shuf_perc))
```

## NULL DISTRIBUTION

- Repeat this shuffling many times and then look at the distribution of all the resulting simulated test statistics

```{r cache=TRUE}
many_shuffles <- do(10000) *
  (shuffled_state_means <- wash_or %>%
     mutate(state = shuffle(state)) %>% 
     group_by(state) %>%
     summarize(mean_shuf_perc = mean(black_perc)))
rand_distn <- many_shuffles %>% 
  group_by(.index) %>% 
  summarize(diffmean = diff(mean_shuf_perc))
```

## Plot of NULL DISTRIBUTION {.build}

```{r fig.height=2.7}
rand_distn %>% ggplot(aes(x = diffmean)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 20)
```

Where will the center of this distribution always be?

- 0 (We assumed the means were the same & used that process to build the distribution).

## View the $p$-value {.build}

We want to see where our observed effect (the original different in sample means) falls on our NULL DISTRIBUTION.

- Note that we check for both directions here since we had a two-sided $H_A$.

```{r fig.height=2.7}
rand_distn %>% ggplot(aes(x = diffmean,
                      fill = (abs(diffmean) >= obs_diff))) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 20)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
library(readr)
write_rds(rand_distn, "rand_distn.RDS")
```


## View the $p$-value {.build}

```{r fig.height=2.7}
rand_distn %>% ggplot(aes(x = diffmean)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 20) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = obs_diff, color = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = -obs_diff, color = "red")
```


## Calculate the $p$-value

```{r}
rand_distn %>%
  filter(abs(diffmean) >= obs_diff) %>%
  nrow() / nrow(rand_distn)
```

So there is around a 4% chance we could have seen results such as this if the true population mean percentages were the same.  What does that mean?

## Significance level

The "beyond a reasonable doubt" in statistics corresponds to setting the $\alpha$ value before you conduct your test.  Most often this is set to 5%.

So with our test, since 0.0439 < 0.05, we reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_A$.  We have evidence to support the claim that the mean percentages of black residents per county are different for Washington and Oregon.

## All data

- The 2015 data for ALL counties is available via:

```{r eval=FALSE}
cc_full <- read_csv("/shared/isma5720@pacificu.edu/cc_full.csv")
```

Practice:  Determine what the actual difference is in mean percentage of black residents for ALL Washington and Oregon counties.  Is the difference **practically** large?
