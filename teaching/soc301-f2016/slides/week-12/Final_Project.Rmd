## Main Article

Write your main article here i.e. the part that will show in print or online.
If you are interested in formatting tips, go to RStudio Menu Bar -> Help -> 
Markdown Quick Reference.



## Supplementary Materials

Write your extra materials here i.e. extra info for people who want to know
more, but including in the main article would unnecessarily bloat things.
