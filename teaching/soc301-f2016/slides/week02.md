#### Covered content

#### To do for next time

- Complete as much as possible of Lab 1
    - Lab 1 draft (must attempt all exercises for credit) due on Tuesday at 3 PM
    - Great way to study for the quiz

#### Getting Lab 1

- First create a new folder called `lab1` in your **LastnameFirstname** folder by
clicking the New Folder button in the **Files** tab in the lower right of RStudio
- To obtain the lab, copy the following R code into the Console:

    ```
    file.copy(from = "/shared/isma5720@pacificu.edu/lab1.Rmd",
              to = "/home/EMAIL/LastnameFirstname/lab1")
    ```

    where `EMAIL` is your Pacific email (mine is isma5720@pacificu.edu) and
`LastnameFirstname` is where you have shared your RStudio project with me (mine is IsmayChester).

- You now can work on the `lab1.Rmd` file and save your results there.
