#### Getting Lab 3 (in groups of 3)

- To obtain the lab, copy the following R code into the Console where `EMAIL` is your Pacific email (mine is isma5720@pacificu.edu) and
`LastnameFirstname` is where you have shared your RStudio project with me (mine is IsmayChester):

    ```
    file.copy(from = "/shared/isma5720@pacificu.edu/lab3.Rmd",
              to = "/home/EMAIL/LastnameFirstname/")
    ```

- You now can work on the `lab3.Rmd` file and save your results there.
- You'll only turn in one lab per your group.  Your partners have been assigned in the Google Sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/a/pacificu.edu/spreadsheets/d/1x9gAqaf7eO9IHA52KbLqX7USIsQSGeMS43JHIv8C4io/edit?usp=sharing).
