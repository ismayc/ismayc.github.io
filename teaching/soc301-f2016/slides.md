## Week 6

### Wednesday

#### Getting Take Home Exam 1

- To obtain the exam, copy the following R code into the Console where `EMAIL` is your Pacific email (mine is `isma5720@pacificu.edu`) and
`LastnameFirstname` is where you have shared your RStudio project with me (mine is `IsmayChester`):

    ```
    file.copy(from = "/shared/isma5720@pacificu.edu/exam1.Rmd",
              to = "/home/EMAIL/LastnameFirstname/")
    ```

- You now can work on the `exam1.Rmd` file and save your results there.
- The exam is due at 2 PM PDT on Monday, October 10.  You don't need to do anything to turn it in other than making sure you have saved the `exam1.Rmd` file and knitted to HTML to produce an `exam1.html` file before the deadline.
