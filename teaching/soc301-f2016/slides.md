#### Getting Lab 2

- First create a new folder called `lab2` in your **LastnameFirstname** folder by
clicking the New Folder button in the **Files** tab in the lower right of RStudio
- To obtain the lab, copy the following R code into the Console:

    ```
    file.copy(from = "/shared/isma5720@pacificu.edu/lab2.Rmd",
              to = "/home/EMAIL/LastnameFirstname/lab2")
    ```

    where `EMAIL` is your Pacific email (mine is isma5720@pacificu.edu) and
`LastnameFirstname` is where you have shared your RStudio project with me (mine is IsmayChester).

- You now can work on the `lab2.Rmd` file and save your results there.
