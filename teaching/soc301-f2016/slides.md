#### Covered content
- Make sure needed R packages are installed

- Share your RStudio project with me
- Walk through many of the examples in Chapters 3-5 of Getting Used to R book

#### To do for next time
- Read Chapter 3 of MODERN DIVE textbook
- Complete LC3.1 - LC3.6 and other questions in [PS2](https://goo.gl/forms/aARWrXTGt9xblOlU2) by 10 AM on Monday
- Complete as much as possible of Lab 1
    - Lab 1 draft (must attempt all exercises for credit) due on Tuesday at 3 PM
    - Great way to study for the quiz

#### Getting Lab 1

- First create a new folder called `lab1` in your LastnameFirstname folder by
clicking the New Folder button in the **Files** tab in the lower right of RStudio
- To obtain the lab, copy the following R code into the Console:

```
file.copy(from = "/shared/isma5720@pacificu.edu/lab1.Rmd",
          to = "/home/EMAIL/LastnameFirstname/lab1")
```

where `EMAIL` is your Pacific email (mine is isma5720@pacificu.edu) and
`LastnameFirstname` is where you have shared your RStudio project with me (mine is IsmayChester).
- You now can work on the `lab1.Rmd` file and save your results there.
