Here are a few examples of presentations I've given. I'm always eager to speak with others about the ways AI, statistics, and effective data communication intersect and how they can better support our day-to-day lives and our work processes. If you have an event or conference in mind, please [get in touch](mailto:chester.ismay@gmail.com).
