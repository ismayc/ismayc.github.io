# Getting on the same page

### Make sure that you've

  1. [Downloaded and installed git on your machine](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html)
  2. Created a GitHub account at <http://github.com>
  3. [Downloaded and installed R and RStudio Desktop](http://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio.html) 
  4. Entered your [GitHub information](https://goo.gl/forms/ryaJCgjiLOxSFcr53) so Andrew can add you to GitHub Classroom

- For a description of the different commands and arguments in <small>`git`</small>, check [this](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git.html) out 
---

## Introduce yourself to Git

- [Open the shell](http://happygitwithr.com/shell.html#shell)

    * One way: In RStudio, go to Tools > Shell
    
--

- Enter the following replacing my name & email with yours

    * Your email needs to be the same as the one you signed up on GitHub with

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git config --global user.name 'Chester Ismay'
git config --global user.email 'cismay@reed.edu'
```

---

## Initialize repository

- Determine what folder you are currently at in the shell

```{bash eval=FALSE}
pwd
```

- Set a folder to correspond to a `git` repository


```{bash eval=FALSE}
git init
```

???

Start drawing on the board here

---

## Create and add a file to repo

- Create a text file called <small>`git_workshop.txt`</small>

    * Save it in the same folder as the repo
--

- To add this file to the repository to be tracked, run

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git add git_workshop.txt
```

???

Can also add folders and all of their files if inside this folder

--

- Can add all files in the folder using `.` 

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git add .
```


???

Git works great with text files, CSVs, etc.  Since R Markdown is plain text, it works great but it works
with many of other plain text files too.

Step away from the shell... Create text file in RStudio

---

## Check the status / Make commit

- To see that the file has been added, use

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git status
```
--

- To record the changes to the repository, use
```{bash eval=FALSE}
git commit -m "Add blank file"
```

--

- Creating a good commit message is not fun, but it can save you in the long run

???

Current tense is preferred on your commit message

---

## Check the status / Make changes

- To see that changes to the repository have been recorded, use 

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git log --oneline
```
--

- Make a change to the text file by adding "gitting it together" and save your file
--

- Check that the file has been modified

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git status
```

---

## Add the file & commit

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git add .
git commit -m "Add line of text"
git log --oneline
```

---

## Fixing my typo

- You can go back to a previous commit using
  - Use with caution!

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git reset --hard [commit]
```

- You can collaborate with others...uh... easily
--

- You can back up your code to the cloud
