## Traditional approach to writing a senior thesis <br> involving statistical analysis

***

.footnote[<center>These slides available at <http://bit.ly/thesisdown17></center>]
--

### - Import data set into statistical software package

--

### - Run the procedure to get results
--

### - Copy & paste appropriate pieces from the analysis into editor
--
 
### - Add descriptions
--

### - Finish/submit report



---

## Disadvantages of this process

***

.footnote[<center>These slides available at <http://bit.ly/thesisdown17></center>]
--

### - Lots of manual work (prone to make errors)
--

### - Tedious (who likes to carefully copy-and-paste?)
--

### - Likely not recordable (did you write down all the steps you followed to get your analysis?)
--

### - What if you made an error at the beginning of your analysis?  If your data had an error?

# Reproducible research

class: center, middle

### "**Reproducible research** is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them."

### - Roger Peng, Johns Hopkins

---

## Why would reproducible research be of value with senior theses?

***

--

### - Updating your code at the very beginning has little impact on all of your analysis throughout the rest of the document
--

### - Documents how you performed your analysis for use YEARS later
--

### - Prepares you for submitting articles that may require revisions
--

### - Assists in others building off/from your work
--

### - Tech companies are moving more and more towards reproducible research/analysis to help with employee turnover

### "Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to humans what we want the computer to do." 

### - Donald Knuth, _Literate Programming_ (1984)

## What is Markdown?

***

.footnote[<center>These slides available at <http://bit.ly/thesisdown17></center>]
--

### - A "plaintext formatting syntax"
--

### - Type in plain text, render to more complex formats
--

### - One step beyond writing a <small>`txt`</small> file
--

### - Render to HTML, PDF, etc.

## What does it look like?

.left-column[
```
  # Header 1
  
  
  ## Header 2
  
  
  Normal paragraphs of text go here.
  
  
  **I'm bold**

## What is R Markdown?
  
***  
  
- "Literate programming"
- Embed R code in a Markdown document
- Renders textual output along with graphics

.left-column[

```
```{r}
x <- rnorm(100)
length(x)
qplot(x, 
      color = I("white"),
      bins = 10)
```
```
]

.right-column[
```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
x <- rnorm(100)
length(x)
qplot(x, 
      color = I("white"),
      bins = 10)
```
]

## But then I have to learn R...

---

## Tools to make working with R friendly
***

### - RStudio is a powerful user interface that helps you get better control of your analysis.
--

### - Like R, it is also completely free.
--

### - You can write your entire paper/report (text, code, analysis, graphics, etc.) all in R Markdown.
--

### - If you need to update any of your code, R Markdown will automatically update your plots and output of your analysis and will create an updated PDF file.

# `thesisdown` <br><br> The Reed College <br> R Markdown <br> Senior Thesis Template

---

## Using predefined templates

***

### - The PDF made via R Markdown uses the existing $\LaTeX\,$ template
- This is to keep the formatting to match what has been approved

--

### - You don't need to know any $\LaTeX\,$ to write your thesis now
- Except for entering equations like $Y = mX + b$ which requires you to use the dollar signs
- For example, `$Y = mX + b$`
