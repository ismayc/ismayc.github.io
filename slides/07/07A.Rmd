# Confidence Intervals


## {.flexbox .vcenter}

**Confidence Interval**: a plausible range of values for a population parameter.

## Construction of a CI {.build}

If the distribution of the point estimate can be well-approximated by the Normal Distribution:

$$ \textrm{point estimate} \pm \textrm{margin of error} $$
$$ \textrm{point estimate} \pm 1.96 \times SE $$

- *point estimate*: $\hat{p}$, $\bar{x}$, $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$
- *standard error (SE)*: standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the point estimate.


## Question

"The proportion of Americans who want to support funding for Planned Parenthood is estimated
to be between 57.1% and 62.9% with 95% confidence." Which of the TWO following interpretations
are reasonable?

1. The interval [.571, .629] provides a plausible range for $\hat{p}$
2. We are certain that the population proportion lies within this interval.
3. If we took many more samples of the same size and computed many $\hat{p}$'s <br> and
many CIs, around 95% of those CIs would contain the population <br> proportion $p$.
4. 95% of all surveys conducted with differing sample sizes will have between 57.1% and 62.9% in support of funding Planned Parenthood.
5. We are 95% confident that the true proportion of Americans who want to support funding for
Planned Parenthod is between 57.1% and 62.9%.
