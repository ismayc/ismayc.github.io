## Shape Q

Which of these variables do you expect to be uniformly distributed?

1. weights of adult females
2. salaries of a random sample of people from Oregon
4. birthdays of classmates (day of the month)
5. Two of the above

## Center: mean {.build}

What could $X$ represent?


```r
x <- c(8, 11, 7, 7, 8, 11, 9, 6, 10, 7, 9)
```


\[ \frac{8 + 11 + 7 + 7 + 8 + 11 + 9 + 6 + 10 + 7 + 9}{11} = \frac{93}{11} = 8.45 \\
  \\
\]

**Sample mean**: the arithmetic mean of the data (vs *pop mean*)

\[ \bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n}{n} \quad \quad \textrm{vs.} \quad \quad \mu\]


```r
mean(x)
```

```
## [1] 8.5
```


## Center: median {.build}

**Median**: the middle value of a sorted data set.


```r
sort(x)
```

```
##  [1]  6  7  7  7  8  8  9  9 10 11 11
```

```r
median(x)
```

```
## [1] 8
```

Break ties by averaging middle two if necessary.


## Center: mode {.build}

**Mode**: the most frequently observed value in the data set.


```r
table(x)
```

```
## x
##  6  7  8  9 10 11 
##  1  3  2  2  1  2
```


```r
mode(x)
```

```
## [1] "numeric"
```

Keep note of the measures of "typical" that are reported - they come quick!


## Spread: variance {.build}

**Sample variance**: roughly, the mean squared deviation from the mean.

\[ s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}\]

Compare to the *population variance*, $\sigma^2$, which divides by $n$.


## Spread: variance {.build}


```r
x - mean(x)
```

```
##  [1] -0.45  2.55 -1.45 -1.45 -0.45  2.55  0.55 -2.45  1.55 -1.45  0.55
```

```r
(x - mean(x))^2
```

```
##  [1] 0.21 6.48 2.12 2.12 0.21 6.48 0.30 6.02 2.39 2.12 0.30
```

```r
sum((x - mean(x))^2) / (length(x) - 1)
```

```
## [1] 2.9
```

```r
var(x)
```

```
## [1] 2.9
```


## Spread: standard deviation {.build}

**Sample standard deviation**: the square root of the variance. Used because
units are the same as the data.

_Interpretation_:  Roughly, the typical difference between a value in the data set and its mean

\[ s = \sqrt{s^2} \]


```r
sqrt(var(x))
```

```
## [1] 1.7
```

```r
sd(x)
```

```
## [1] 1.7
```

Compared to the *population standard deviation*, $\sigma$.


## Spread: IQR {.build}

**Inner Quartile Range**: the range of the middle 50% of the data.

\[ IQR = Q_3 - Q_1 \]


```r
sort(x)
```

```
##  [1]  6  7  7  7  8  8  9  9 10 11 11
```

```r
IQR(x)
```

```
## [1] 2.5
```


## Spread: range {.build}

**Range**: the range of the full data set.

\[ range = max - min \]


```r
max(x) - min(x)
```

```
## [1] 5
```

```r
range(x)
```

```
## [1]  6 11
```

```r
diff(range(x))
```

```
## [1] 5
```
