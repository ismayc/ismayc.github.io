## Spread Q

Which measure(s) of spread would be LEAST sensitive to the presence of outliers?

3. IQR
4. Range
5. Depends on the data set

## Spread Q {.build}

Recall `x`


```r
x <- c(8, 11, 7, 7, 8, 11, 9, 6, 10, 7, 9)
```


```r
y <- x
y[2] <- 37
```

Sorted `x` and `y`


```r
sort(x)
```

```
##  [1]  6  7  7  7  8  8  9  9 10 11 11
```

```r
sort(y)
```

```
##  [1]  6  7  7  7  8  8  9  9 10 11 37
```

## Compare `x` and `y` {.build}


```r
var(x)
```

```
## [1] 2.872727
```

```r
var(y)
```

```
## [1] 77.56364
```


## Spread Q {.build}


```r
c(IQR(x), IQR(y))
```

```
## [1] 2.5 2.5
```

```r
diff(range(x))
```

```
## [1] 5
```

```r
diff(range(y))
```

```
## [1] 31
```

## Mean vs median {.build}

<img src="../figs/skew-sym.png" alt="skewsym" width="650">

The mean (red line) is sensitive to extreme values, so it gets pulled towards 
the tail. The median (dashed line) is less sensitive.

For symmetric distributions, use *mean* and *sd*.

For skewed distributions, use *median* and *IQR*.
