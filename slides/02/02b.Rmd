## The Typical Human

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2xOvKFFz4)

Keep note of the measures of "typical" that are reported - they come quick!

# Plicker time!

<!--
## Spread Q

Which measure(s) of spread would be LEAST sensitive to the presence of outliers?

2. standard deviation
3. IQR
4. Range
5. Depends on the data set
-->

## Spread Q {.build}

Recall `x`

```{r recall-x}
x <- c(8, 11, 7, 7, 8, 11, 9, 6, 10, 7, 9)
```

```{r create-y}
y <- x
y[2] <- 37
```

Sorted `x` and `y`

```{r sort}
sort(x)
sort(y)
```

## Compare `x` and `y` {.build}

```{r compare_x&y}
var(x)
var(y)
```


## Spread Q {.build}

```{r distxy}
c(IQR(x), IQR(y))
diff(range(x))
diff(range(y))
```

## Spread Q

## Mean vs median {.build}

<img src="../figs/skew-sym.png" alt="skewsym" width="650">

The mean (red line) is sensitive to extreme values, so it gets pulled towards 
the tail. The median (dashed line) is less sensitive.

For symmetric distributions, use *mean* and *sd*.

For skewed distributions, use *median* and *IQR*.
