## Example: shipping books {.build}

When you buy a book from Amazon, you get a quote for how much it
costs to ship. This is largely based on the weight of the book. If you
didn't know the weight of a book, what other characteristics of it
could you measure to help predict weight?

```{r getdata, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(DAAG)
data(allbacks)
books <- allbacks[, c(3, 1, 4)]
```


## Example: shipping books

```{r plotallbacks}
qplot(x = volume, y = weight, data = books)
```


## Example: shipping books {.smaller}

```{r fitm1, echo = FALSE}
m1 <- lm(weight ~ volume, data = books)
```

```{r plotallbackswline}
qplot(x = volume, y = weight, data = books) + 
  geom_abline(intercept = m1$coef[1], slope = m1$coef[2], col = "orchid")
```


## {.build .smaller} 

```{r}
m1 <- lm(weight ~ volume, data = books)
summary(m1)
```

Q1: What is the equation for the line?

$$ \hat{y} = 107.7 + 0.708 x $$
$$ \widehat{weight} = 107.7 + 0.708 volume $$


## {.build .smaller}

Q2: Is volume a significant predictor?

```{r sumtable}
summary(m1)
```

Q3: How much of the variation in weight is explained by the model containing volume?


## {.build}

Q4: Does this appear to be a reasonable setting to apply linear regression?

We need to check:

1. **L** inear trend
2. **I** ndependent observations/errors
3. **N** ormal residuals
4. **E** qual variance


## Residual Plot

```{r resplot}
qplot(x = .fitted, y = .stdresid, data = m1)
```


## QQ plot

```{r resplot2}
qplot(sample = .stdresid, data = m1) + geom_abline(col = "purple")
```

# Multiple Regression

## Multiple Regression {.build}

Allows us to create a model to explain one $numerical$ variable, the response, as a linear function of many explanatory variables that can be both $numerical$ and
$categorical$.

We posit the true model:

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \ldots + \beta_p X_p + \epsilon; \quad \epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2) $$

We use the data to estimate our fitted model:

$$ \hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x_1 + b_2 x_2 + \ldots + b_p x_p $$


## Estimating $\beta_0, \beta_1$, etc. {.build}

In least-squares regression, we're still finding the estimates that minimize
the sum of squared residuals.

$$ \sum_{i = 1}^n {e_i}^2 = \sum_{i = 1}^n \left(y_i - \hat{y}_i\right)^2$$

<!--
**Mathy note:** They have a closed-form solution.

$$ \mathbf{b} = (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{y} $$ where $\mathbf{b} = (b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_p)$, $\mathbf{b} = (b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_p)$, \mathbf{X} = ()

-->

In R:

```{r eval = FALSE}
lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + ... + xp, data = mydata)
```



## Example: shipping books {.build}

```{r plotcolors}
qplot(x = volume, y = weight, color = cover, data = books)
```


## {.build .smaller}

```{r}
m2 <- lm(weight ~ volume + cover, data = books)
summary(m2)
```

<center>
### How do we interpret these estimates?
</center>

#


## Example: shipping books {.build .smaller}

```{r echo = FALSE}
qplot(x = volume, y = weight, color = cover, data = books) +
  geom_abline(intercept = m2$coef[1], slope = m2$coef[2], col = 2) +
  geom_abline(intercept = m2$coef[1] + m2$coef[3], slope = m2$coef[2], col = 4)
```


## MLR slope interpretation {.build}

The slope corresponding to the dummy variable tell us:

- How much vertical separation there is between our lines
- How much `weight` is expected to increase if `cover` goes
from 0 to 1 and `volume` is left unchanged.

Each $b_i$ tells you how much you expect the $y$ to change when you change the
$x_i$ **by one unit**, while **holding all other variables constant**.


## {.smaller .build}

```{r}
summary(m2)
```

- Is the difference between cover types significant?
- How much of the variation in weight is explained by a model containing both
volume and cover?

<!--
##

```{r}
m2 <- lm(weight ~ volume + cover, data = books)
summary(m2)$coef
qt(.025, df = nrow(books) - 3)
```

Which of the following represents the appropriate 95% CI for `coverpb`?

- A. $197 \pm 1.96 \times 59.19$
- B. $-184 \pm 2.18 \times 40.5$
- C. $-184 \pm -4.55 \times 40.5$
