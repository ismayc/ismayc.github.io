```




## Extending the model

```{r parallel_lines_plot, echo = FALSE}
m2 <- lm(weight ~ volume + cover, data = books)
qplot(x = volume, y = weight, color = cover, data = books) +
  geom_abline(intercept = m2$coef[1], slope = m2$coef[2], col = 2) +
  geom_abline(intercept = m2$coef[1] + m2$coef[3], slope = m2$coef[2], col = 4)
```

The two cover types have different intercepts. Do they share the same slope?


## Extending the model

```{r diff_slopes_plot, echo = FALSE}
qplot(x = volume, y = weight, color = cover, data = books) +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```


## {.smaller .build}

```{r interaction_model}
m3 <- lm(weight ~ volume + cover + volume:cover, data = books)
summary(m3)
```

Do we have evidence that two types of books have different relationships
between volume and weight?


## Take home messages {.build}

- There is a statistically significant relationship between volume and weight.
- There is a statistically significant difference in weight between paperback
and hardcover books, when controlling for volume.
- There is not strong evidence that the relationship between volume and weight
differs between paperbacks and hardbacks.

This is **inference**, which required **valid models**. We'll now check diagnostics.

## Ex: Restaurants in NYC {.build}

```{r read_nyc, echo = FALSE}
nyc <- read.csv("http://andrewpbray.github.io/data/nyc.csv")
```

```{r struc_nyc}
head(nyc, 3)
dim(nyc)
```

What is the unit of observation?

*A restaurant*


## What determines the price of a meal?

Let's look at the relationship between price, food rating, and decor rating.

```{r scatter3d, echo=FALSE, webgl=TRUE}
library(rgl)
invisible(open3d())
rgl.viewpoint(zoom = .7)
plot3d(x = nyc$Food, y = nyc$Decor, z = nyc$Price, col = "steelblue", 
       xlab = "Food rating", ylab = "Decor Rating", zlab = "Price")
```

## With fitted plane

```{r scatter_and_plane3d, echo=FALSE, webgl=TRUE}
m1 <- lm(Price ~ Food + Decor, data = nyc)
coefs <- m1$coef
#invisible(open3d())
rgl.viewpoint(zoom = .7)
planes3d(coefs["Food"], coefs["Decor"], -1, coefs["(Intercept)"],
         alpha = 0.4, col = "lightgray")
```


## What determines the price of a meal?

\[ Price \sim Food + Decor \]

```{r contin_fit}
head(nyc, 3)
m1 <- lm(Price ~ Food + Decor, data = nyc)
```

## Model 1: Food + Decor {.smaller}

```{r summary_m1}
summary(m1)
```


## The geometry of regression models {.build}

The function for $\hat{y}$ is . . .

- A *line* when you have one continuous $x$.
- *Parallel lines* when you have one continuous $x_1$ and one categorical $x_2$.
- *Unrelated lines* when you have one continuous $x_1$, one categorical $x_2$, 
and an interaction term $x_1 : x_2$.

When you have two continuous predictors $x_1$, $x_2$, then your mean function
is . . .

*a plane*


## 3D plot

```{r mod1_plot, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, webgl=TRUE}
rgl.viewpoint(zoom = .7)
m1 <- lm(Price ~ Food + Decor, data = nyc)
coefs <- m1$coef
planes3d(coefs["Food"], coefs["Decor"], -1, coefs["(Intercept)"],
         alpha = 0.4, col = "lightgray")
```


## Location, location, location

Does the price depend on where the restaurant is located in Manhattan?

\[ Price \sim Food + Decor + East \]

```{r head_nyc}
head(nyc, 3)
```


## Model 2: Food + Decor + East {.smaller}

```{r add_east}
m2 <- lm(Price ~ Food + Decor + East, data = nyc)
summary(m2)
```


## The geometry of regression models {.build}

- When you have two continuous predictors $x_1$, $x_2$, then your mean function
is *a plane*.
- When you have two continuous predictors $x_1$, $x_2$, and a categorical 
predictor $x_3$, then your mean function represents *parallel planes*.


## 3D Plot

```{r intersecting_lines, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, webgl = TRUE}
m2 <- lm(Price ~ Food + Decor + East, data = nyc)
colvec <- rep("steelblue", dim(nyc)[1])
colvec[nyc$East == 1] <- "orange"
coefs <- m2$coef
rgl.viewpoint(zoom = .7)
planes3d(coefs["Food"], coefs["Decor"], -1, coefs["(Intercept)"],
         alpha = 0.4, col = "steelblue")
planes3d(coefs["Food"], coefs["Decor"], -1, coefs["(Intercept)"] + coefs["East"],
         alpha = 0.4, col = "orange")
```

## The geometry of regression models {.build}

- When you have two continuous predictors $x_1$, $x_2$, then your mean function
is *a plane*.
- When you have two continuous predictors $x_1$, $x_2$, and a categorical 
predictor $x_3$, then your mean function represents *parallel planes*.
- When you add in interaction effects, the planes become *tilted*.


## Model 3: Food + Decor + East + Decor:East {.smaller}

```{r interaction_model2}
m3 <- lm(Price ~ Food + Decor + East + Decor:East, data = nyc)
summary(m3)
