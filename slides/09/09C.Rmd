## Wolf River {.build}

- The Wolf River in Tennessee flows past an abandoned site once used by the 
pesticide industry for dumping wastes, including hexachlorobenzene (HCB).
- HCB known to cause various cancers and birth defects.


## Wolf River study {.build}

- Standard method to test whether HCB is present in a river is to take samples
at mid-depth. 
- HCB is denser than water, so is it found at different concentrations at 
different depths?

```{r wolf-data, echo=2:3}
wolf <- read.table("wolfriver.txt", header = TRUE)
str(wolf)
```


## Wolf River data

```{r wolf-boxes, echo = FALSE}
wolf <- read.table("wolfriver.txt", header = TRUE)
qplot(x = Depth, y = HCB, data = wolf, geom = "boxplot")
```

<!--
## Wolf River data

```{r wolf-densities, echo = FALSE}
qplot(x = HCB, color = Depth, data = wolf, geom = "density")
```

Which of the following plots shows groups with means that are *most* and *least*
likely to be significantly different from each other?

1. most: I, least: II

4. most: III, least: II

- I has a high observed $F$ statistic.
- II has a low observed $F$ statistic.
- III has a middling observed $F$ statistic.


## Wolf River data {.build}

```{r wolf-boxes2, echo = FALSE, fig.height=3}
qplot(x = Depth, y = HCB, data = wolf, geom = "boxplot")
f <- anova(aov(HCB ~ Depth, data = wolf))
f[, 1:4]
```

How big is `r f$F[1]`?


## ANOVA F-test {.build}

$$ H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \ldots = \mu_k $$
$$ H_A: \textrm{At least one } \mu_j \textrm{ is different} $$

We can find the distribution of the $F$-statistic under the null hypothesis by

- Randomization
- Distributional approximation


## Sampling dist for $F$ statistic via Randomization

```{r randoF2, eval = FALSE}
F_stats <- rep(0, 10000)
wolf2 <- wolf

for (i in 1:10000) {
  wolf2$Depth <- sample(wolf2$Depth)
  F_stats[i] <- anova(aov(HCB ~ Depth, data = wolf2))$F[1]
}

qplot(x = F_stats, geom = "density")
```


## Sampling dist for $F$ statistic via Randomization

```{r randoF, echo = FALSE, fig.height=3.5}
F_stats <- rep(0, 10000)
wolf2 <- wolf
set.seed(2016)

for (i in 1:10000) {
  wolf2$Depth <- sample(wolf2$Depth)
  F_stats[i] <- anova(aov(HCB ~ Depth, data = wolf2))$F[1]
}

qplot(x = F_stats, geom = "density")
```

```{r Fpval}
mean(F_stats > 3.03)
```


## Sampling dist for $F$ via Approximation {.build}

If

- independent observations,
- nearly normal distributions for each group, and
- constant variance between groups,

then the sampling distribution for the $F$ statistic under $H_0$ is well-approximated by a Fisher's $F$ distribution with $df_1 = k - 1$ and $df_2 = n_{total} - k$. 

- The $p$-value is represented by the upper tail. 

- $n_{total}$ is the overall sample size and $k$ is the number of groups of the explanatory variable.


## Sampling dist for $F$ via Approximation

```{r Fmethods, echo = FALSE}
qplot(x = F_stats, geom = "density") +
  stat_function(fun = df, args = c(df1 = 2, df2 = 27), col = "tomato")
```


## Wolf River Conclusions {.build}

```{r conc, fig.height=3, echo = FALSE}
qplot(x = Depth, y = HCB, data = wolf, geom = "boxplot")
```

- With a $p$-value of $\approx 0.07$, it is questionable whether HCB concentration
functions the same at all three depths, based on these observed sample means.
- *Replicating the study* could add some certainty.
- In a subsequent study, we may wish to only test mid-depth versus bottom.
