## Recap:  Hypothesis testing for a single mean

1. State hypotheses: e.g. $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ versus $H_A: \mu \ne \mu_0$
2. Check conditions <br>
    - Independent observations  
    - Small sample size ($n < 30$) and nearly normal population
    OR <br>
    Large sample size ($n \ge 30$)
3. Compute observed $t$-statistic: $t_{obs} = \dfrac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}$
4. Draw picture to assess where $t_{obs}$ falls on $t_{df = n - 1}$
5. Compute a (two-tailed) $p$-value
6. State conclusion in terms of the alternative hypothesis


## Confidence interval for $\mu$ {.build}

point estimate $\pm$ margin of error

$$ \bar{x}_{obs} \pm (t^*_{df} \times SE) $$

- $\bar{x}$: point estimate of $\mu$.
- $t^*_{df}$: critical value that leaves $\alpha$ in the tails of a $t$ with 
$df = n - 1$.
- $SE$ (standard error of $\bar{x}$): $s_{obs}/\sqrt{n}$.

# Shifting to two means

## IQ and Sex {.build}

```{r include = FALSE}
# tweak data set to increase dependence
gifted[19, "motheriq"] <- 130
gifted[9, "motheriq"] <- 112
gifted[21, "fatheriq"] <- 120
gifted[4, "fatheriq"] <- 123
gifted[15, "fatheriq"] <- 121
#gifted <- gifted %>% 
#  mutate(sex = rep(c("male", "female")))
d <- data.frame(IQ = c(gifted$fatheriq, gifted$motheriq),
                sex = rep(c("male", "female"), each = nrow(gifted)))
set.seed(184)
d <- d[sample(1:nrow(d)), ]
head(d)
```

Consider a data set containing the IQs of 36 people who identify as male and 36 people who identify as female. Researchers use this data to test the following hypotheses with $\alpha = 0.05$.

$$
H_0: \mu_{M} - \mu_{F} = 0 \\
H_A: \mu_{M} - \mu_{F} \ne 0
$$


## {.smaller}

```{r}
(ds <- d %>% group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(IQ),
            s = sd(IQ),
            n = n()) )
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=3}
#qplot(x = IQ, data = d, geom = "bar", facets = ~ sex, fill = I("linen"), col = I("darkseagreen"))
qplot(x = sex, y = IQ, data = d, geom = "boxplot")
```


## Two sample t-test {.build}

- We have a point estimate: $\bar{x}_{M, obs} - \bar{x}_{F, obs}$

```{r}
diff(ds$mean)
```

- We can calculate a standard error: $\sqrt{\dfrac{s_{M, obs}^2}{n_{M}} + \dfrac{s_{F, obs}^2}{n_{F}}}$

```{r}
sqrt(ds$s[1]^2 / ds$n[1] + ds$s[2]^2 / ds$n[2])
```


## Two sample t-test (cont.) {.build}

- We can calculate the df of the $t$ distribution

```{r}
min(ds$n[1] - 1, ds$n[2] - 1)
```


- Our test statistic:

$$ t_{obs} = \frac{\textrm{point est.} - \textrm{null value}}{SE} = \frac{-2.83 - 0}{1.28} = -2.21 $$

## A $p$-value

```{r}
pt(-2.21, df = 35) * 2
```

- Does this support the hypothesis that mean IQs tend to be different between men and women?

    - Yes, since `r pt(-2.21, df = 35) * 2` < 0.05.


## But we need to check conditions {.build}

- Independent observations?
- Nearly normal populations?
```{r nnormal, echo=FALSE, message =FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 2.5}
qplot(x = IQ, data = d, geom = "histogram", facets = ~ sex, fill = I("purple"), col = I("white"))
```
- Large enough sample sizes?
    - $n_{M, obs} = n_{F, obs} = 36 > 30$

- We can be relatively confident the $t$ distribution applies here.  
    - Could also check via randomization.  How?

## Original Data

Data were collected from schools in a large city on a set of thirty-six randomly selected children
who were identified as gifted children soon after they reached the age of four. 

```{r}
head(gifted, 3)
```

- The actual IQs reported were the father's IQ and mother's IQ for each child since researchers were interested in understanding the relationship, if any, between the analytical skills of young gifted children and their father's and mother's IQ (among other things).

## Dependence between samples

```{r scatterplot, echo = FALSE}
qplot(x = motheriq, y = fatheriq, data = gifted)
```


## Paired data {.build}

If there is a natural pairing between observations in two groups of size $n$, it 
can make more sense to analyze them as a single sample of $n$ differences.

```{r}
gifted %>%
  mutate(diff = fatheriq - motheriq) %>%
  select(fatheriq, motheriq, diff)
```


## Paired t-test {.build}

$H_0: \mu_{diff} = 0$ versus $H_A: \mu_{diff} \ne 0$

### Check conditions
1. Independent pairs?

2a. Nearly normal population of differences?

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=2}
g <- gifted %>%
  mutate(diff = fatheriq - motheriq)
qplot(x = diff, data = g, geom = "density",fill = I("linen"), col = I("darkseagreen"))
```

2b. Large enough number of pairs? <br>
    - Yes, 36 > 30
    
## Paired t-test (cont.) {.build}

- Compute a test statistic: $\bar{x}_{d, obs}$

```{r}
(gs <- gifted %>%
  mutate(diff = fatheriq - motheriq) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(diff), s = sd(diff), n = n()))
(t_obs <- (gs$mean - 0)/(gs$s/sqrt(gs$n)))
pt(t_obs, df = 35) * 2
```


## Paired compared {.build}

```{r}
gs$s / sqrt(gs$n)
sqrt(ds$s[1]^2 / ds$n[1] + ds$s[2]^2 / ds$n[2])
```

While the point estimate is the same in the paired and independent tests $$\bar{x}_{M} - \bar{x}_F = \bar{x}_d,$$ if
the data is paired, the dependency leads to a smaller SE.

This principle is widely used in experiment design, e.g. pre- and post-test.


## The takeaway {.build}

If you are comparing means between two groups and the data has a natural pairing,
analyze the data as **one sample** of differences.

<!--
Think of it as an analysis of $W$, not $W \sim X$.
