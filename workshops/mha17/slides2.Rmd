# Visualizing sampling

- Let's explore data on profiles of [San Francisco OKCupid users](https://github.com/rudeboybert/okcupiddata).

- This data contains information about/questions asked of 59,946 OkCupid users who were
  - living within 25 miles of San Francisco, 
  - had active profiles on June 26, 2012, 
  - were online in the previous year, and 
  - had at least one picture in their profile.

---

# Visualizing sampling

- Let's think of these 59,946 users as our <u>population</u>
--

  - Visualize their self-reported heights in inches
--

  - Then take samples from the population of heights and visualize those

### The population

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-reported heights of San Francisco OKCupid users in 2012

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=5.5, message=FALSE}
library(okcupiddata)
data(profiles)
library(tidyverse)
profiles_subset <- profiles %>% filter(between(height, 55, 80))
ggplot(data = profiles_subset, mapping = aes(x = height)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = "white") +
  labs(x = "\nHeight (in inches)") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(54, 82, 2)) +
  theme(axis.text=element_text(size=18),
        axis.title=element_text(size=20,face="bold"))
```

---


### One random sample

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-reported heights of 100 San Francisco OKCupid users in 2012

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=5.5, message=FALSE}
library(mosaic)
set.seed(2017)
profiles_sample1 <- profiles_subset %>% 
  resample(size = 100, replace = FALSE)
ggplot(data = profiles_sample1, mapping = aes(x = height)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = "white", fill = "blue") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(55, 80)) +
  labs(x = "\nHeight (in inches)") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(54, 82, 2)) +
  theme(axis.text=element_text(size=18),
        axis.title=element_text(size=20,face="bold"))
```

---


### Another random sample

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-reported heights of 100 San Francisco OKCupid users in 2012

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=5.5, message=FALSE}
library(mosaic)
profiles_sample2 <- profiles_subset %>% 
  resample(size = 100, replace = FALSE)
ggplot(data = profiles_sample2, mapping = aes(x = height)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = "white", fill = "forestgreen") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(55, 80)) +
  labs(x = "\nHeight (in inches)") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(54, 82, 2)) +
  theme(axis.text=element_text(size=18),
        axis.title=element_text(size=20,face="bold"))
```

### One more random sample

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-reported heights of 100 San Francisco OKCupid users in 2012

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=5.5, message=FALSE}
profiles_sample3 <- profiles_subset %>% 
  resample(size = 100, replace = FALSE)
ggplot(data = profiles_sample3, mapping = aes(x = height)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = "white", fill = "brown") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(55, 80)) +
  labs(x = "\nHeight (in inches)") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(54, 82, 2)) +
  theme(axis.text=element_text(size=18),
        axis.title=element_text(size=20,face="bold"))
```

### A convenience sample

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-reported heights of 100 San Francisco OKCupid users in 2012
--

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=5.5, message=FALSE}
profiles_sample4 <- profiles_subset %>% filter(height >= 72)
ggplot(data = profiles_sample4, mapping = aes(x = height)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = "white", fill = "red") +
    coord_cartesian(xlim = c(55, 80)) +
  labs(x = "\nHeight (in inches)") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(54, 82, 2)) +
  theme(axis.text=element_text(size=18),
        axis.title=element_text(size=20,face="bold"))
```

# The sampling distribution of the mean

- Let's suppose we were interested in estimating the mean height of all OKCupid San Francisco profiles.  To do so, we could look at the mean of the height variable in our first sample:

- Mean of sample 1: `r profiles_sample1 %>% summarize(mean(height))` inches

---

# The sampling distribution of the mean

- Or we could have just used the mean of sample 2
- Mean of sample 2: `r profiles_sample2 %>% summarize(mean(height))` inches

---

# The sampling distribution of the mean

- Or the mean of sample 3
- Mean of sample 3: `r profiles_sample3 %>% summarize(mean(height))` inches

---

# The sampling distribution of the mean

- Or the mean of sample 4?
- Mean of sample 4: `r profiles_sample4 %>% summarize(mean(height))` inches

---

# The sampling distribution of the mean

- The fact that the estimate of our population mean changes based on the sample selected is called <u>sampling variability</u>.  

- You can view the sampling variability by looking at sample means from many different samples in what is known as <u>the sampling distribution of the mean</u>.

---

# The sampling distribution of the mean

#### Mean height (inches) from random samples of OKCupid profile heights

```{r cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=5.5, message=FALSE}
many_sample_means <- do(10000) *
  (profiles_subset %>% 
  resample(size = 100, replace = FALSE) %>% 
  summarize(mean_height = mean(height)))
ggplot(data = many_sample_means, mapping = aes(x = mean_height)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = "white", fill = "black") +
  labs(x = "\n Mean Height (in inches)") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(67, 70, 0.5)) +
  theme(axis.text=element_text(size=18),
        axis.title=element_text(size=20,face="bold"))
```

# Gapminder data

### We will be working with data derived from the data Hans Rosling gave in his presentation from yesterday.

- You can view the full data set in interactive form [here](http://ismayc.github.io/workshops/mha17/materials/gapminder_full.html)

- Please download the CSV of this data to your computer [here](http://ismayc.github.io/workshops/mha17/materials/gapminder_full.csv)

# Comparisons to make based on inference

1. Was the proportion of Autocratic countries lower in 2007 than in 1957?
1. Did European countries have a statistically different mean GDP per capita in 2002 than Asian countries?
1. Was the mean life expectancy for countries in South America in 2007 greater than 75 years?
1. Were the majority of African countries in 1962 Democratic?

# BREAK TIME

### Think about two other statistical questions you could answer based on this data and write them down.

# BREAK TIME

## What do the different pieces of the diagram look like for each of our questions?

1. Was the proportion of Autocratic countries lower in 2007 than in 1957?
1. Did European countries have a statistically different mean GDP per capita in 2002 than Asian countries?
1. Was the mean life expectancy for countries in South America in 2007 greater than 75 years?
1. Were the majority of African countries in 1962 Democratic?

## Four common types of problems in inference

- Test for Single Mean
- Test for Single Proportion
- Test for Difference in Means
- Test for Difference in Proportions

--

### Match each of these tests with the problems on the previous slide

- To assist think about 
    - how many variables are in the problem
    - what type of variable each is
---
