I've led many workshops on using R and R Markdown at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reed.edu">Reed College</a> for a variety of topics including

- data analysis
- statistical inference
- data visualization
- reproducible research
- senior thesis development
- interactive data visualization
- dynamic web application frameworks using `shiny`
- importing and tidying/reshaping data

Slides from many of these workshops and other projects can be found on my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rpubs.com/cismay">RPubs.com page</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ismayc/talks">on GitHub</a>.
