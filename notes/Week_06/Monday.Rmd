```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# List of useful packages
pkg <- c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "knitr")

# Check if packages are not installed and assign the
# names of the uninstalled packages to the variable new.pkg
new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages())]

# If there are any packages in the list that aren't installed,
# install them
if (length(new.pkg)) {
  install.packages(new.pkg, repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
}

# Load the packages into the current environment

1. Hand back exams
    - If you have a lot of checks, you are doing great.  If you have a lot of X's, I encourage you to come talk to me.
    - Talk about 10d
        - Conditioning on infected so that determines which note cards to mark
        - The size of the piles is determined by how many were in no net and net in our experiment
    - Talk about 11
        - There are potentially many other factors and saying that where one goes to school causes median earnings 10 years out is faulty.
        - An experiment likely couldn't be done here for ethical reasons.

2.  Remind them to turn in PS5

3. Go over slides and two Plicker questions
    - Take Plicker photo (request permission to take picture)

4. Lab tomorrow on Normal Distribution
